# libvita3d

TL;DR: Don't use this.

simple and fast (using the GPU) 3D library for the Vita.

A big THANK YOU to Xerpi for writing the original libvita2d, most of the work was done by him.
Sorry to those I offended by not mentioning him.

Install instructions: download and unzip, run make, run make install, and add -lvita3d to your LIBS variable in your Makefile.

If you somehow found this, it's outdated. Go and use the real 3D library for Vita, that one actually supports shaders.
